# PowerShell Cheatsheet

## Discovery within PowerShell
* `Get-Command write-*` : get all commands that begin with "write-"
* `Get-Help Get-Command -detailed` : find out how to use "Get-Command"
* `Get-Date | Get-Member` : get all methods and properties of the DateTime object, just pipe the object to `Get-Member`. *(In PowerShell, every output is a .NET object.)*

## Good to know
* `$_` is the variable for the current value in the pipeline.
* **In PowerShell, every output is a .NET object.**

## Functions
Function output consists of everything that isn't captured :
```powershell
function bar {
	$procs = Get-Process svchost
	"Returning svchost process objects"
	return $procs
}
```
The above function returns :
```
PS> $result = bar
PS> $result | foreach {$_.GetType().Fullname}
	System.String
	System.Diagnostics.Process
	System.Diagnostics.Process
	System.Diagnostics.Process
	...
```
It returns the Process objects but also the string that has not been captured.
> First, the `return` keyword allows you to exit the function at any particular point. You may also "optionally" specify an argument to the return statement that will cause the argument to be output just before returning. `return $procs` does not mean that the functionâ€™s only output is the contents of the $procs variable. In fact this construct is semantically equivalent to `$procs; return`.

To avoid the unwanted output, just throw it away by casting it to "void" :
```powershell
function LongNumericString {
	$strBld = new-object System.Text.StringBuilder
	for ($i=0; $i -lt 20; $i++) {
		[void]$strBld.Append($i)
	}
	$strBld.ToString()
}

LongNumericString
```
Try this code with and without the `[void]` cast.

## Debugging
* Use `Get-Member` to display **properties and methods** available on objects.
* Use `Format-List *` to display all the **property values** on objects.
* Create the filter "Get-TypeName" : `filter Get-TypeName {if ($_ -eq $null) {'<null>'} else {$_.GetType().Fullname }}` and use it to see the type names of each object passed down the pipe : `Get-Date | Get-TypeName`

## Cardinality (Collections, scalars, empty)
Each individual element of the collection is sent down the pipe, one after the other. PowerShell flattens Collections automatically.

To manually flatten the collection:
```powershell
foreach ($item in $array) {$item} | Get-TypeName
```

If you don't want your collection to be flattened, you can wrap it in an array (using the unary comma operator) :
```powershell
 ,$array | Get-TypeName
```

If you do a foreach on a scalar variable, PowerShell will treat it as if it were a collection containing just that one scalar value.

The "array subexpression operator" `$files = @(Get-ChildItem *.sys)` force the result to be a collection. It does nothing if it's already a collection : `$array = @(1,2,3,4)`

Rules of empty set :
1. Valid output can consist of no output.
2. When assigning output to a variable in PowerShell, `$null` is used to represent an empty set.
3. The foreach statement iterates over a scalar once, even if that scalar happens to be $null.

## Pipeline bound paramters
It's unnecessary to write :
```powershell
Get-ChildItem . *.cs -r | Foreach { Get-Content $_.fullname } | ...
```
You can use directly :
```powershell
Get-ChildItem . *.cs -r | Get-Content | ...
```
Because many PowerShell cmdlets bind their "primary" parameter to the pipeline. This is indicated in the help (`Get-Help Get-Content -Full`) :
> Required? true   
> Position? 1   
> Default value N/A - The path must be specified   
> **Accept pipeline input? true (ByPropertyName)**   
> Accept wildcard characters? true
